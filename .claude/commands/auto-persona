# Simplified auto-persona command that integrates with Claude more seamlessly

construct_persona_prompt() {
    local user_request="$1"
    
    cat << 'PROMPT_EOF'
First, analyze this request to determine the most appropriate persona:

[PERSONAS AVAILABLE]
1. alex-chen-fullstack: Security expert, Python/C#, full-stack development
2. sarah-martinez-ml: ML/AI optimization, batch processing, extended thinking
3. marcus-thompson-devops: Enterprise deployment, compliance, infrastructure
4. jamie-rodriguez-api: API design, real-time systems, streaming
5. rachel-kim-architect: System design, team leadership, best practices

[REQUEST TO ANALYZE]
PROMPT_EOF
    echo "$user_request"
    
    cat << 'PROMPT_EOF'

Based on your analysis:
1. State which persona is best suited (with confidence %)
2. Briefly explain why (1 sentence)
3. Then respond to the request AS THAT PERSONA, following the ENGINEERING-PRINCIPLES of always consulting official documentation first

Begin your response with:
"Selected: [persona-name] (X% confidence) - [reasoning]"

Then provide the full response as that persona.
PROMPT_EOF
}

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Auto-Persona for Claude Code"
    echo "Usage: auto-persona \"your request here\""
    exit 0
fi

user_request="$*"
full_prompt=$(construct_persona_prompt "$user_request")

echo "ðŸ¤– Auto-selecting persona and processing request..."
echo ""
claude "$full_prompt"
