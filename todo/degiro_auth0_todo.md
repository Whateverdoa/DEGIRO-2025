# DEGIRO Trading Agent Authentication - Complete TODO

## Project Status: ⚠️ Authentication Challenge Identified

**Key Finding**: DEGIRO does not support passkeys/WebAuthn. Traditional credential management required with significant security considerations.

## Phase 1: Authentication & Credential Management (Week 1)

### 1.1 Evaluate Authentication Options
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Acknowledge DEGIRO ToS violation risk for automation
- [ ] Document all authentication methods available:
  - [ ] Username/Password (required)
  - [ ] TOTP 2FA (optional but recommended)
  - [ ] No passkey/WebAuthn support confirmed
- [ ] Research alternative brokers with official API support
- [ ] Create risk assessment document for stakeholder review

### 1.2 Credential Management Strategy
- [ ] **Option A**: Dashlane CLI Integration (Recommended)
  - [ ] Install and configure Dashlane CLI
  - [ ] Store DEGIRO credentials in Dashlane vault
  - [ ] Create secure credential retrieval functions
  - [ ] Test CLI automation workflow
  
- [ ] **Option B**: Local Encrypted Storage (Fallback)
  - [ ] Implement local credential encryption using Fernet
  - [ ] Create secure key management system
  - [ ] Set up credential rotation mechanisms
  
- [ ] **Option C**: Environment Variables (Development Only)
  - [ ] Create .env template for development
  - [ ] Add .env to .gitignore
  - [ ] Document security limitations

### 1.3 TOTP Secret Extraction
- [ ] **Manual Process Required** (One-time setup):
  - [ ] Log into DEGIRO web platform
  - [ ] Navigate to Security Settings → Enable 2FA
  - [ ] Capture QR code during setup process
  - [ ] Extract TOTP secret using Python/CLI tools
  - [ ] Store secret securely in chosen credential manager
  - [ ] Test TOTP generation functionality

### 1.4 Secure Implementation Framework
```python
# Credential manager interface
- [ ] Create `CredentialManager` abstract base class
- [ ] Implement `DashlaneCredentialManager` 
- [ ] Implement `LocalEncryptedCredentialManager`
- [ ] Create credential validation functions
- [ ] Add credential rotation scheduling
```

## Phase 2: DEGIRO Integration with Security Focus (Week 2)

### 2.1 API Wrapper Development
- [ ] Research and select unofficial DEGIRO library:
  - [ ] `degiro-connector` (Python) - most mature
  - [ ] `pladaria/degiro` (JavaScript/Node.js)
  - [ ] Compare features, maintenance, and security
- [ ] Create secure DEGIRO API wrapper:
  - [ ] Rate limiting (max 1 request per 2 seconds)
  - [ ] Session management with auto-reconnection
  - [ ] Error handling and retry logic
  - [ ] Request/response logging for debugging

### 2.2 Authentication Flow Implementation
```python
- [ ] Create `DEGIROAuthenticator` class
- [ ] Implement username/password authentication
- [ ] Add TOTP code generation and validation
- [ ] Create session persistence mechanism
- [ ] Add authentication failure handling
- [ ] Implement logout and cleanup procedures
```

### 2.3 Connection Health Monitoring
- [ ] Create connection health check functions
- [ ] Implement automatic reconnection logic
- [ ] Add authentication state monitoring
- [ ] Create session timeout handling
- [ ] Log authentication events for audit trail

## Phase 3: Risk Mitigation & Safety Measures (Week 3)

### 3.1 Automated Detection Avoidance
- [ ] **Behavioral Patterns**:
  - [ ] Implement random delays between requests (2-10 seconds)
  - [ ] Vary request timing patterns to mimic human behavior
  - [ ] Add weekend/holiday trading suspension
  - [ ] Create "lunch break" periods with no activity
  
- [ ] **Technical Fingerprinting**:
  - [ ] Use realistic User-Agent strings
  - [ ] Implement browser-like request headers
  - [ ] Add realistic session durations
  - [ ] Rotate request patterns monthly

### 3.2 Emergency Stop Mechanisms
- [ ] Create global "kill switch" functionality
- [ ] Implement automated trading suspension triggers:
  - [ ] Account balance thresholds
  - [ ] Unusual market volatility detection
  - [ ] Multiple failed authentication attempts
  - [ ] API error rate thresholds
- [ ] Add manual override capabilities
- [ ] Create emergency contact procedures

### 3.3 Audit and Compliance
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging:
  - [ ] All authentication attempts
  - [ ] API requests and responses
  - [ ] Trading decisions and executions
  - [ ] Error conditions and recovery actions
- [ ] Create audit trail export functionality
- [ ] Add data retention policies
- [ ] Implement log encryption and integrity checks

## Phase 4: Alternative Broker Research (Parallel Track)

### 4.1 Official API Brokers Evaluation
- [ ] **Interactive Brokers**:
  - [ ] Research TWS API capabilities
  - [ ] Compare fee structures with DEGIRO
  - [ ] Test API access and documentation quality
  - [ ] Evaluate geographic availability
  
- [ ] **Saxo Bank**:
  - [ ] Research OpenAPI platform
  - [ ] Compare trading instruments available
  - [ ] Evaluate minimum deposit requirements
  - [ ] Test API sandbox environment
  
- [ ] **Alpaca**:
  - [ ] Research commission-free trading API
  - [ ] Evaluate supported markets (US-focused)
  - [ ] Test paper trading environment
  - [ ] Compare available trading instruments

### 4.2 Migration Planning
- [ ] Create broker comparison matrix
- [ ] Calculate total cost of ownership (fees, spreads, etc.)
- [ ] Plan portfolio migration strategy
- [ ] Create parallel testing environment
- [ ] Develop migration timeline and checkpoints

## Phase 5: Implementation Decision Point (Week 4)

### 5.1 Go/No-Go Decision Framework

## Risk Acknowledgment

**By proceeding with DEGIRO automation, you acknowledge:**

1. **Terms of Service Violation**: Using automated tools with DEGIRO violates their terms of service
2. **Account Termination Risk**: DEGIRO may permanently close your account without warning
3. **No Recourse**: Appeals process for automation violations is limited
4. **Financial Risk**: Potential complications accessing funds after account termination
5. **Legal Risk**: Possible legal implications depending on jurisdiction
6. **Technical Risk**: Unofficial APIs may break without notice

## Recommended Decision Tree

```
1. Can you afford to lose DEGIRO account access? 
   ├─ NO: Choose Option C (Full Migration)
   └─ YES: Continue to question 2

2. Do you need automation for all trading?
   ├─ NO: Choose Option B (Hybrid Approach)  
   └─ YES: Continue to question 3

3. Are you willing to accept high technical and legal risks?
   ├─ NO: Choose Option C (Full Migration)
   └─ YES: Proceed with Option A (High Risk Implementation)
```

## Success Metrics

- **Security**: Zero credential leaks, 100% secure storage compliance
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime during market hours
- **Compliance**: Zero ToS violations detected (impossible to guarantee with DEGIRO)
- **Performance**: <5 second authentication, <2 second API response times
- **Risk Management**: All emergency stops functional, audit trail complete

---

**Next Steps**: Review this plan, make go/no-go decision, and select implementation path based on risk tolerance and requirements.
