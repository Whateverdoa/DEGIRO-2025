# MCP Integration TODO for Multi-Agent Project

## Overview
Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) to standardize tool access across multiple agent personas, reducing integration complexity and improving scalability.

## Phase 1: Assessment & Planning

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] **Audit existing agent personas** and their current tool integrations
  - List all agent types (developer, QA, PM, etc.)
  - Document current tools each agent uses
  - Identify custom integration code that can be standardized
- [ ] **Map tool dependencies** across agents
  - Which tools are shared between personas?
  - Which integrations are duplicated?
  - What authentication/permission patterns exist?
- [ ] **Identify integration pain points**
  - Where do agents struggle with tool access?
  - Which integrations break most often?
  - What tools are hardest to add new agents to?

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Define MCP server requirements** for existing tools
  - GitHub/GitLab integration needs
  - Database access patterns
  - Monitoring/alerting systems
  - Communication tools (Slack, Teams, etc.)
  - Project management tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- [ ] **Plan authentication strategy**
  - How will MCP servers handle credentials?
  - What permission levels does each persona need?
  - How to handle API rate limits across agents?

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure

### MCP Server Development
- [ ] **Create base MCP server template**
  ```python
  # Standard server structure for all tool integrations
  class BaseMCPServer:
      def __init__(self, tool_name, config):
          # Authentication, rate limiting, error handling
  ```
- [ ] **Implement priority MCP servers** (start with most-used tools)
  - [ ] GitHub/GitLab MCP server
  - [ ] Database MCP server  
  - [ ] Monitoring MCP server
  - [ ] Communication MCP server (Slack/Teams)
- [ ] **Build shared context server**
  - Agent coordination and state sharing
  - Project-wide event broadcasting
  - Cross-agent communication channel

### Agent Base Classes
- [ ] **Create MCP-enabled base agent class**
  ```python
  class MCPAgent:
      def __init__(self, persona_type, project_context):
          # Load tools based on persona and project
  ```
- [ ] **Implement tool registry system**
  - Central management of available MCP servers
  - Persona-to-tool permission mapping
  - Project-specific tool configurations
- [ ] **Design persona-specific tool wrappers**
  - High-level interfaces that hide MCP complexity
  - Persona-appropriate method names and workflows

## Phase 3: Migration Strategy

### Gradual Rollout
- [ ] **Choose pilot persona and project** for initial testing
  - Select least critical agent type first
  - Pick project with clear success metrics
- [ ] **Create parallel implementation**
  - Keep existing integrations running
  - Implement MCP versions alongside
  - A/B test functionality and performance
- [ ] **Migrate one tool at a time** per persona
  - Start with most stable/simple integrations
  - Validate each migration before proceeding

### Agent Refactoring
- [ ] **Update existing agent code** to use MCP base classes
  ```python
  # Before: Custom tool integrations
  class DeveloperAgent:
      def __init__(self):
          self.github_client = GitHubAPI(token)
          self.db_client = DatabaseClient(url)
  
  # After: MCP-based tool access  
  class DeveloperAgent(MCPAgent):
      def __init__(self, project):
          super().__init__("developer", project)
          # Tools loaded automatically based on persona
  ```
- [ ] **Standardize error handling** across all tool interactions
- [ ] **Implement consistent logging** for tool usage and failures

## Phase 4: Enhanced Capabilities

### Cross-Agent Coordination
- [ ] **Implement shared project context**
  - Agents can read/write shared state
  - Event-driven updates between agents
  - Conflict resolution for concurrent actions
- [ ] **Build agent workflow orchestration**
  - Define handoff points between agent types
  - Implement approval/review workflows
  - Create agent-to-agent communication protocols

### Advanced Tool Features
- [ ] **Add tool usage analytics**
  - Track which tools each agent uses most
  - Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
  - Monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] **Implement intelligent tool selection**
  - Agents can discover available tools dynamically
  - Context-aware tool recommendations
  - Fallback mechanisms when primary tools fail

## Phase 5: Configuration & Deployment

### Project Configuration System
- [ ] **Create project-specific tool configs**
  ```yaml
  # project-config.yaml
  project: "web-app-v2"
  agents:
    developer:
      tools: [github, database, monitoring, deployment]
      permissions: {github: [read,write], database: [read]}
    qa:
      tools: [github, jira, testing]
      permissions: {github: [read], jira: [read,write]}
  ```
- [ ] **Build configuration validation**
  - Ensure required tools are available
  - Validate permission combinations
  - Check for circular dependencies

### Deployment Infrastructure
- [ ] **Set up MCP server hosting**
  - Containerized deployment for each MCP server
  - Load balancing and failover
  - Health monitoring and auto-recovery
- [ ] **Create agent deployment pipeline**
  - Automated testing of agent+tool integrations
  - Staged rollouts across environments
  - Rollback procedures for failed deployments

## Phase 6: Testing & Validation

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **Test agent-tool interactions** in isolation
- [ ] **Validate cross-agent coordination** scenarios
- [ ] **Performance test** with multiple concurrent agents
- [ ] **Security audit** of tool access and permissions

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] **Run pilot projects** with MCP-enabled agents
- [ ] **Compare metrics** before/after MCP integration
  - Agent response times
  - Error rates
  - Tool integration failures
  - Development velocity
- [ ] **Gather feedback** from team members working with agents

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] **Reduced integration code** (target: 60% reduction in custom tool code)
- [ ] **Improved reliability** (target: 50% fewer tool-related failures)
- [ ] **Faster agent deployment** (target: 3x faster to add tools to new agents)

### Team Metrics  
- [ ] **Developer productivity** when adding new agent capabilities
- [ ] **Time to onboard** new team members to agent system
- [ ] **Agent effectiveness** in completing assigned tasks

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [ ] **MCP server reliability** - Implement robust failover and circuit breakers
- [ ] **Performance overhead** - Benchmark and optimize MCP communication
- [ ] **Security concerns** - Regular security audits and credential rotation

### Project Risks
- [ ] **Migration complexity** - Detailed rollback plans for each phase
- [ ] **Team adoption** - Training sessions and documentation
- [ ] **Timeline pressure** - Optional features that can be delayed if needed

## Documentation & Training

### Technical Documentation
- [ ] **MCP server API documentation** for each tool integration
- [ ] **Agent development guide** using new MCP base classes
- [ ] **Troubleshooting guide** for common MCP issues

### Team Training
- [ ] **Workshop on MCP concepts** for development team
- [ ] **Hands-on training** for creating new agent personas
- [ ] **Best practices guide** for tool integration patterns
